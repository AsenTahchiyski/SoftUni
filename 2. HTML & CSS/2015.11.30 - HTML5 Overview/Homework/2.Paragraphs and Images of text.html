			<br><font face="arial" size="3" color="grey">
			<br>So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
			<br>This one, this form I hold now.
			<br>Embracing you, this reality here,
			<br>This one, this form I hold now, so
			<br>Wide eyed and hopeful.
			<br>Wide eyed and hopefully wild.
			<br>
			<br>We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
			<br>Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
			<br>This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
			<br>This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.
			<br>
			<br>We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment
			<br>We are choosing to be here right now
			<br>Hold on, stay inside...
			<br>
			<br>This holy reality, this holy experience
			<br>Choosing to be here in...
			<br>This body, this body holding me
			<br>Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
			<br>This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
			<br>All this pain is an illusion
			<br>
			<br>Alive!
			<br>
			<br>In this holy reality, in this holy experience
			<br>Choosing to be here in...
			<br>This body, this body holding me
			<br>Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
			<br>This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
			<br>All this pain is an illusion
			<br>
			<br>Twirling round with this familiar parable
			<br>Spinning, weaving round each new experience
			<br>Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
			<br>A chance to be alive and breathing
			<br>
			<br>This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
			<br>Embrace this moment, remember, we are eternal
			<br>All this pain is an illusion.</font>
